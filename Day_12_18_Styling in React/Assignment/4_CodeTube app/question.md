# CodeTube app

You have created an online course-buying platform called CodeTube Catalog, where you can buy courses and follow/unfollow your favorite instructors.

You realize that the “follow/unfollow” and “add to bag” buttons are similar. The course list and instructor list styles are also similar.

Note: Add role="img" attribute to the image elements of the react components.

So, you decide to create reusable components called Button and Container using styled-components. The Button component should have a bg property which sets the background color and the Container should have a flex  property which sets the flex value.
You have also built individual components like Course, Sidebar, etc. When you add/remove a course from the bag, the count of courses in the bag doesn’t get updated. Find a way to fix this issue without changing the output.
