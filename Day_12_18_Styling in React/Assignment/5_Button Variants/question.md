# Button Variants

Generally web applications often have multiple buttons, and most of them have similar features and styles.


You want to create a reusable button component called `ButtonView` using styled components which can be modified based on the properties that are being passed.
The ButtonView component should display an outlined button by default. The button should have a black border and text and white background.

### The ButtonView styled component should have the following properties

- `filled` - Displays a button with a black background and white text by default

- `bg` - Changes the background color of the filled button

- `color` - Changes the text color of the filled button

Note: `bg` and `color` should only apply styles to a filled button.
Use named CSS colors when applying default styles to the reusable Button component.
